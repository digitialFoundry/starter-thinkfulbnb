After 480px, the Nav menu and the form elements are misaligned. I suggest you to make the form elements in a horizontal position along with the "Search" button to counter this issue after 480px width. [Take a look]: https://paste.pics/I4072 .
You have also missed the entire "Ideas" section in your webpage. [Take a look]: https://paste.pics/I407G .
In the Desktop/tablet view, please consider adding the spaces between two adjacent Images and the paragraph. [Take a look]: https://paste.pics/I1B3D .
At 340px screen width, The font-size of the logo is too large and creating a white bar down the right side of the screen. [Take a look]: https://paste.pics/I1B3J . Please try to resolve this issue.
Please try to resolve these issues as they are critical to pass the assessment. Submit your work after careful revision. Thanks
